I am excited to be applying for the yourtitle position with yourcompany. I have always loved learning and yourcompany dedication to sharing knowledge and doing work that really matters inspires me. As someone who likes a challenge, I excel at wrangling data, building models, and presenting my findings. I feel that I would fit right in as I believe that knowledge is something that should be shared to ensure the best possible future.

During my apprenticeship at yourcompany, I worked on several projects using various machine learning models, both supervised and unsupervised. Working closely with a yourtitle, I optimized these projects to increase the efficacy of previously-used methods. I presented these findings not only to the yourtitle, but also to an audience of my peers with varying levels of industry knowledge. With my strong background in analytics, research, and strong communication, I would love to use my skills to create products that will allow us to gain insight into user experiences of yourcompany courses.

Thank you for your consideration. I am excited to utilize my experience in data science along with my passion for helping others to contribute to the yourcompany team. I look forward to speaking with you and presenting my work.
