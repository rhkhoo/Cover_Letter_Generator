In my five-year career as a yourtitle, I have honed my legal research and writing skills, and the attorneys I’ve worked with have complimented me on my command of case law and litigation support. yourcompany 20 years in practice proves that the firm has strong values and excellent attorneys, which is why I want to be a part of the yourcompany team.

I currently serve as a paralegal for yourcompany, where I work closely with the partners on a number of high-priority cases. During my time here, I implemented a new calendar system that ensures timely filing of court papers. This system has prevented missed deadlines and allowed for better organization of internal and client meetings.

Previously, as a yourtitle for the yourcompany, I received praise for my overall support of the legal team and my positive attitude.

My further qualifications include a bachelor’s degree from yourschool, a yourmajor certificate, and training in LexisNexis, Westlaw, and Microsoft Office Suite.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to yourcompany team. Thank you in advance for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.
