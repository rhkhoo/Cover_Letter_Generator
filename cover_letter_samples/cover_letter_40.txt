As a yourmajor at yourschool preparing to graduate next month, I am eager to launch my career in yourtitle. Your news reporter opening advertised on yourwebsite is an excellent match to my qualifications.

While studying at yourschool, I gained experience as a:

yourtitle at yourcompany, where I wrote news and feature articles of interest to Sometown residents.
yourtitle at yourcompany, where I earned a “National Pacemaker Award” (considered to be the “Pulitzer Prize” of American college student journalism) for my series on a fraternity hazing.
yourtitle for yourcompany, a student-run news website covering the local and national political scene that I co-launched and grew to 7,500 subscribers. In this role, my colleagues and I produced short-form videos as well as long-form features for daily newscasts.
yourtitle covering the university’s football and basketball teams for their website.
In both classroom and work settings, I earned a reputation as a dedicated yourtitle with a passion for accurately covering important issues and events, engaging readers and helping fuel positive change.

It would be an honor to report for your award-winning yourcompany and work with your talented team of yourtitle. I am confident that my experience publishing and promoting content on social media and delivering on multiple platforms would benefit your yourcompany as you move to digital delivery.
