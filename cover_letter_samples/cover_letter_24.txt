My day to day activities are close related to Albert Einstein's wise words: "Try not to  become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value." I believe that if I dream big and work hard to achieve my goals, someday I can make people lives better. Therefore my life would be better. 

One of my best decisions was to start learning Java and start building a career in the yourtitle industry. It took me 5 years, after my graduation from university to realize that I'm a passionate introvert who opened to the world, thanks to his career in sales. Yes, I was a sales man, working for different companies, few of which are mentioned in my resume, but please do not think of me as one more person who is searching for big financial benefits in the IT industry and nothing to show in return. One of my dreams was to be a programmer, but never had the courage to pursue it until past few years. I'm proud to say "was", not "is". I did it! And it feels good!


If we have the chance to know each other, you would probably recognize that I'm very hard working individual, a perfectionist, constantly setting new goals to achieve, new mountain tops to climb (literally). I want to know how things works, curiosity drives me. Knowing how to deliver value and generate revenue by doing a quality and thoughtful work, feels like this would be valuable asset for you in the future. 

One of the biggest performance boosters is when  you cooperate with the other people in your team and sustain good working environment with them and this is a skill that I've mastered. I have the feeling that I found the organization I'm meant to be in, I hope you feel the same about me.
