I am applying for the position of yourtitle with your company as advertised on yourwebsite. 

I have spent the past 8+ years doing number crunching and database management for yourcompany, and I am keen to continue developing my career in the field of yourtitle. I have always been a numbers person, with exceptional mathematics and computer skills. I am fluent in a number of data management systems and software, including Excel, mySQL, SPSS, and Oracle 11i. Statistical significance, A/B testing, and data-driven optimization are the rhythm of the drumbeat I march to. 

As much as I’m into data manipulation, it’s the analysis of data that really gets me going. I like to explore the relationships between numbers, and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staff. 

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work; the only thing cleaner than my room are my spreadsheets. I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

Please find my contact information at the top of this letter, as well as on my enclosed resume. I appreciate your time spent reading this letter, and look forward to connecting in the future.
