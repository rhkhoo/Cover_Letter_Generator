In your job opening of yourtitle not only are you are seeking someone who is a strong brand advocate but is also driven to make this tangible. As a brand guardian on the agency side this has given me first-hand insight into how to achieve a consistent brand on-strategy, effectively and efficiently.  

I would be delighted to contribute my experience transferring the skills that I have developed managing strategic pitches and projects (brand development) on a day-to-day basis, identifying the right talent, lead in-house (or freelance) design teams to deliver brand identity, as well as elevate level of consulting/presentations and general organisation/budgeting.

Part of my role also includes getting the best out of consumer research (qualitative and quantitative) and interpreting findings to work against. I enjoy partnering with marketing clients at different levels, managing key stakeholders and local countries as well as collaborating cross function with consumer insight, R&D and partner suppliers (advertising and research agencies). 

Thank you very much for your consideration.
