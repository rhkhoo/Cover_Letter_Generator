Are you searching for a yourtitle with a proven ability to develop high-performance applications and technical innovations? If so, please consider my enclosed resume.

Since 2015, I have served as a yourtitle for yourcompany, where I have been repeatedly recognized for developing innovative solutions for multimillion-dollar, globally deployed software and systems. I am responsible for full lifecycle development of next-generation software, from initial requirement gathering to design, coding, testing, documentation and implementation.

Known for excellent client-facing skills, I have participated in proposals and presentations that have landed six-figure contracts. I also excel in merging business and user needs into high-quality, cost-effective design solutions while keeping within budgetary constraints.

My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (Windows, Unix, Linux and VxWorks); fluency in 13 scripting/programming languages (including C, C++, VB, Java, Perl and SQL); and advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies and best practices (including OOD, client/server architecture and self-test automation).

My experience developing user-friendly solutions on time and on budget would enable me to step into a yourtitle role at yourcompany and hit the ground running. I will follow up with you next week. I look forward to speaking with you.
