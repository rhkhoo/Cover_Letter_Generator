Please accept this letter and the attached resume as an indication of my sincere interest in the open
yourtitle position at yourcompany that I found on yourwebsite I graduated in December 2014 with a degree in yourmajor and would like to
gain experience in the yourmajor field before applying to law school. While reviewing your website, I was
pleased to see that your firm operates in a wide variety of spheres. The areas of your practice to which I
am particularly attracted are the Environment & Natural Resources and Land Use & Condemnation
sectors.
Throughout my college career, the courses I found most interesting were those revolving around
subjects such as law, business, and land use. After taking a course in Land, Law and The Environment,
my professor took me on as an intern to work at the Universityâ€™s Institute for Environmental
Negotiations. My internship included reading reports, analyzing data, conducting active research
contacting persons of interest to arrange interviews, and giving reports of my findings. From my
coursework and professional experiences, I have developed the researching, analytical thinking and
writing skills necessary to be a successful yourtitle. In addition, I am aware of the long hours and
hard work that is required of the role. I am ready to dedicate myself to yourcompany in
much the same way that I committed myself to being a varsity athlete. As a member of the swim team, I
devoted up to 30 hours a week to practices, travel and competition while maintaining a full course load.
I am eager to learn from the many successful lawyers at yourcompany holding high peer
review ratings in accordance with Martindale-Hubbell Legal Network. I hope that you will afford me the
opportunity to become a member of your team.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
