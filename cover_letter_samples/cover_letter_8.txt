My experiences and status as a third-year at the yourschool make me an ideal
candidate for the yourtitle with the yourcompany, which I
learned about at the yourwebsite last month. Your agency
is known for working to ensure equal access to education for every child and promoting
educational excellence throughout the nation. I know that with my background and interest in
helping youth, I am a good fit for your organization.
My volunteer work throughout college has confirmed my interest in and dedication to
childhood education. By volunteering at yourcompany, I learned a
lot about child development by caring for children ranging from three months to three years
old. During my time at yourschool, I had the opportunity to observe student and teacher roles and a
variety of teaching techniques. Later, these skills became important when I volunteered with
the yourcompany and had the opportunity to tutor two high school students. I now
look forward to serving as an advocate for youth education by working in your yourcompany.
I am prepared for this yourtitle as a result of my position as an yourtitle at the yourcompany last summer. There, I coordinated internship placements for
over 200 students in the Sometown community. More specifically, I collected and
organized applications, corresponded with students and sponsors via email and phone,
maintained an updated Excel database of all internship sites and sponsor contacts, and created
orientation packets. I have honed the organizational and time- management skills necessary to
be a successful intern with the yourcompany.
Thank you for reviewing my application. Should you have any questions, you may reach me
