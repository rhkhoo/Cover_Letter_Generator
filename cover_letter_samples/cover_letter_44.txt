As an accomplished yourtitle with extensive industry experience, I was very interested to learn about your yourtitle opening. I offer eight years of experience working for yourcompany, a national home healthcare company and a billion-dollar leader in the industry. As the companyâ€™s yourtitle, I managed:  

Purchasing functions for 115 locations. 
75 major contracts in areas including medications, supplies, equipment, furniture, uniforms, distribution and vending machines. 
A 15-member team of contractors, buyers, analysts and support staff.
Consistently recognized for outstanding performance, I saved yourcompany more than $5.3 million in 2015 alone. An expert in contract negotiations, vendor management and global sourcing, I repeatedly reduced expenditures, cost-of-sales and cost-of-goods, as well as assisted with major system implementations of inventory, purchasing and tracking systems.

In 2016, yourcompany experienced a significant workforce reduction and my position was eliminated. Since then, I have remained active in the American Purchasing Society and completed courses in business ethics, contract law, the art of negotiation and supply chain management. I plan on sitting for the Certified Professional yourtitle exam later this year.

I am confident that my ongoing studies combined with successful experience in the field will enable me to aggressively pursue cost-reduction opportunities and improve return on investment for your company. If you agree that my skills and experience would benefit your operation, please call me or email to arrange an interview. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you.
